    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Y.A.A.R, as a company, requires money to function. Currently, we are making some minor local sales, but so long as our advertisement relies on word of mouth (or vaugely remembered billboards) we're not going to be able to get many customers. As such, we require a website for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spreading awareness of our company</li>
      <li>Letting people book online trips</li>
      <li>Providing information about our rafting experiences</li>
      <li>Ensuring everything's safe</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience is meant to be families, particularly those with children, or youth groups who are rather young, (though to seek them we shall cater to their leaders), and pirate enthusiasts. Our target customers are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Between ages 25-70, ages where one might be able to go rafting with their kids, grandkids, neices and nephews, etc</li>
      <li>Have at least some disposable income (Not a lot: we're not going for the richest of the rich, we're going for common families, and for some new parents affordability can be an issue, which is why we will be advertising ourselves as reasonably-priced fun.)</li>
      <li>Interested in outdoor fun, like whitewater rafting, or interested in going to an... interesting (read: strange) place.  We can advertise slight discounts if people come dressed up like pirates. This is not meant to be a 'nice' thing. this is for notoriety. Imagine being a member of a youth group and finding out you get to go on a trip because everybody dresseed up like pirates. or imagine going to some whitewater rafting place and seeing half the parking lot be filled with people in pirate costumes. It's strange. People will remember strange things. People may talk about strange things. People who like strange things will think 'I want to see that' and go to our place.</li>
      <li>Want safety and a rafting experience that, while exciting, won't scare kids so terribly that they'll end up crying in the corner of the raft instead of having a good time.</li>
      <li>Seek an outdoor experience that, while picturesque and thrilling, will excite tiny kids </li>
      <li>Acessing our site from their desktop or laptop. (though if we can, we should make a mobile version for tourists looking for something fun to do in the area.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>

      <tr>
        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>

      </tr>

        <td class="primary"></td>
        <td class="secondary"></td>
        <td class="accent1"></td>

    </table>

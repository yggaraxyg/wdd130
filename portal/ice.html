                <p class="leftparagraph projectparagraph">This post is the image I used to represent ICE projects! I did this one right after Font Awesome, as a way of learning how to use icons in a project. Completely aside from the project, I rather like the morbidly obese rat picture. it's unhealthy and I would never feed a rat that much, but I think it looks funny.</p>
